## nowein.dev

A Next.js application that contains my personal portfolio and a self-hosted blog where I share articles about life and technology.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Environments

To run locally, you'll need a `.env.local` at the root of the directory with the proper credentials. A reference file can be found in the repository under `.env.example`.
