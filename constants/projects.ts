    description: `A web application I built for my father. He needed an application to log various sport cards for organization and selling purposes. A table displays all cards and their fields (year, fabric, sport, etc.), and a log page is provided to enter in card details. Since my father uses multiple sites to sell, there's a button that provides a download of the database in CSV format from the server. I deployed the application and whitelisted his IP for an AWS VPC.`,
